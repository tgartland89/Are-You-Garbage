# Phase 3 CLI Project- Are you Garbage? 

## About the Game?

Are you Garbage is a CLI mini game based on the popular podcast of the same name hosted by comedians H.Foley and Kevin Ryan. 
Each week they sit down with guests and ask them a series of questions to determine if they are "Classy", "Trashy", or "Garbage" 
The game is in the name of fun even with some wild questions and in this version, players have a bit more simplified process. 

## How to get the game started: 

- Fork the file and run in VS code 
- Open your terminal below and run pipenv install followed by pipenv shell 
- Cd in to “lib/db” 
- Enter python cli.py start (Your Name), hit enter and the game will start. 
- Answer the 10 yes or no questions to generate your 1 of 3 results 
- After the quiz, you have the option than to add a question to the game that could come up in the next round for a new player.
